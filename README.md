## 💡 Why Use Deep Learning for Recommendations?

Traditional recommendation systems use simple rules or fixed formulas. Deep learning improves these by:

- Learning complex patterns directly from data
- Handling large amounts of information without manual rules
- Adapting to changes in user behavior over time
- Providing more accurate and personalized suggestions  
 
This software lets you experience these benefits without needing programming skills.
